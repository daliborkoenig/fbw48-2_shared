### Function return

1. Write a JavaScript function that accepts a string as a parameter and counts the number of vowels within the string.
##### Note : As the letter 'y' can be regarded as both a vowel and a consonant, we do not count 'y' as vowel here.
``` 
    Example string : 'The quick brown fox'
    Expected Output : 5 
```
2. Write a JavaScript function that generates a string id (specified length) of random characters.
```
    Sample character list : ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789
```
3. Write a JavaScript program to pass a 'JavaScript function' as parameter.
``` 
    abc();
    output: abc
```
