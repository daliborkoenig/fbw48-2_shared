    <p><b><em>Shit happens</em></b> is a common vulgar slang phrase that is used as a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism">existential</a> observation that life is full of unpredictable events, similar to "<em>Así es la vida"</em> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_French_expressions_in_English#C.27est_la_vie"><em>"C'est la vie"</em></a>. The phrase is an acknowledgment that bad things happen to people seemingly for no particular reason. The phrase was first observed in 1964, but wasn't used in a print publication until 1983. Alternately said, albeit less vulgarly, as "stuff happens".</p>
    
    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>The fact that people have been remarking that shit happens has been attested from 1964, when Carl Werthman quoted an example in his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley">UCB</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Arts">MA</a> thesis; the relevant excerpt was published in The American City (edited by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anselm_Strauss">Anselm L</a>. Strauss) in 1968.</p>
    
    <p>In a review of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_R._Shapiro">Fred Shapiro</a>'s 2006 work <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Yale_Book_of_Quotations"><em>The Yale Book of Quotations</em></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker"><em>The New Yorker</em></a> critic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Menand">Louis Menand</a> stated that it is "extremely interesting" that the phrase "Shit happens" was introduced to print by Connie Eble, in a publication identified as <em>UNC–CH</em> Slang in 1983.</p>
    
    <p>Seismologists from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Geological_Survey">U.S. Geological Survey</a> launched an earthquake-readiness campaign in California under the title "Shift Happens". A seismologist commented "Stuff happens and you have to prepared."</p>
