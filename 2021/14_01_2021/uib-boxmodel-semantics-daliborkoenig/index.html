       <b>Web design</b>  <p>encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of
            websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design);
            authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and
            search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the
            design process, although some designers will cover them all.[1] The term "web design" is normally used to
            describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing
            markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers
            are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating markup then they are also
            expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.</p>

            <h3>The start of the web and web design</h3>
            In 1989, whilst working at CERN Tim Berners-Lee proposed to create a global hypertext project, which later
            became known as the World Wide Web. During 1991 to 1993 the World Wide Web was born. Text-only pages could
            be viewed using a simple line-mode browser.[2] In 1993 Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, created the Mosaic
            browser. At the time there were multiple browsers, however the majority of them were Unix-based and
            naturally text heavy. There had been no integrated approach to graphic design elements such as images or
            sounds. The Mosaic browser broke this mould.[3] The W3C was created in October 1994 to "lead the World Wide
            Web to its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its
            interoperability."[4] This discouraged any one company from monopolizing a propriety browser and programming
            language, which could have altered the effect of the World Wide Web as a whole. The W3C continues to set
            standards, which can today be seen with JavaScript and other languages. In 1994 Andreessen formed Mosaic
            Communications Corp. that later became known as Netscape Communications, the Netscape 0.9 browser. Netscape
            created its own HTML tags without regard to the traditional standards process. For example, Netscape 1.1
            included tags for changing background colours and formatting text with tables on web pages. Throughout 1996
            to 1999 the browser wars began, as Microsoft and Netscape fought for ultimate browser dominance. During this
            time there were many new technologies in the field, notably Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript, and Dynamic
            HTML. On the whole, the browser competition did lead to many positive creations and helped web design evolve
            at a rapid pace.[5]

            <h3>Evolution of web design</h3>
            <p>In 1996, Microsoft released its first competitive browser, which was complete with its own features and
                HTML
                tags. It was also the first browser to support style sheets, which at the time was seen as an obscure
                authoring technique and is today an important aspect of web design.[5] The HTML markup for tables was
                originally intended for displaying tabular data. However designers quickly realized the potential of
                using
                HTML tables for creating the complex, multi-column layouts that were otherwise not possible. At this
                time,
                as design and good aesthetics seemed to take precedence over good mark-up structure, and little
                attention
                was paid to semantics and web accessibility. HTML sites were limited in their design options, even more
                so
                with earlier versions of HTML. To create complex designs, many web designers had to use complicated
                table
                structures or even use blank spacer .GIF images to stop empty table cells from collapsing.[6] CSS was
                introduced in December 1996 by the W3C to support presentation and layout. This allowed HTML code to be
                semantic rather than both semantic and presentational, and improved web accessibility, see tableless web
                design.

                In 1996, Flash (originally known as FutureSplash) was developed. At the time, the Flash content
                development
                tool was relatively simple compared to now, using basic layout and drawing tools, a limited precursor to
                ActionScript, and a timeline, but it enabled web designers to go beyond the point of HTML, animated GIFs
                and
                JavaScript. However, because Flash required a plug-in, many web developers avoided using it for fear of
                limiting their market share due to lack of compatibility. Instead, designers reverted to gif animations
                (if
                they didn't forego using motion graphics altogether) and JavaScript for widgets. But the benefits of
                Flash
                made it popular enough among specific target markets to eventually work its way to the vast majority of
                browsers, and powerful enough to be used to develop entire sites.[6]</p>

            <h3>End of the first browser wars</h3>
            <p>Further information: Browser wars § First Browser War (1995–2001)
                In 1998, Netscape released Netscape Communicator code under an open source licence, enabling thousands
                of developers to participate in improving the software. However, these developers decided to start a
                standard for the web from scratch, which guided the development of the open source browser and soon
                expanded to a complete application platform.[5] The Web Standards Project was formed and promoted
                browser compliance with HTML and CSS standards. Programs like Acid1, Acid2, and Acid3 were created in
                order to test browsers for compliance with web standards. In 2000, Internet Explorer was released for
                Mac, which was the first browser that fully supported HTML 4.01 and CSS 1. It was also the first browser
                to fully support the PNG image format.[5] By 2001, after a campaign by Microsoft to popularize Internet
                Explorer, Internet Explorer had reached 96% of web browser usage share, which signified the end of the
                first browsers wars as Internet Explorer had no real competition. </p>


            <h3>2001–2012</h3>
            <p>Since the start of the 21st century the web has become more and more integrated into peoples lives. As
                this has happened the technology of the web has also moved on. There have also been significant changes
                in the way people use and access the web, and this has changed how sites are designed.

                Since the end of the browsers wars[when?] new browsers have been released. Many of these are open source
                meaning that they tend to have faster development and are more supportive of new standards. The new
                options are considered by many[weasel words] to be better than Microsoft's Internet Explorer.

                The W3C has released new standards for HTML (HTML5) and CSS (CSS3), as well as new JavaScript API's,
                each as a new but individual standard.[when?] While the term HTML5 is only used to refer to the new
                version of HTML and some of the JavaScript API's, it has become common to use it to refer to the entire
                suite of new standards (HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript).</p>

        <h3>Tools and technologies</h3>
        <p>Web designers use a variety of different tools depending on what part of the production process they are
            involved in. These tools are updated over time by newer standards and software but the principles behind
            them remain the same. Web designers use both vector and raster graphics editors to create web-formatted
            imagery or design prototypes. Technologies used to create websites include W3C standards like HTML and CSS,
            which can be hand-coded or generated by WYSIWYG editing software. Other tools web designers might use
            include mark up validators[8] and other testing tools for usability and accessibility to ensure their
            websites meet web accessibility guidelines.[9]</p>
